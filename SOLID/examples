- Open Closed Principle == system is closed for modification, but open for extension; VSC and addons for example; mixer and instruments; provide mechanism for attachments;

- Barbara Liskov Substitution == Logic and Visualisation should be in different classes for chess game, for example;

- Dependency Inversion == use abstractions, not realizations;

- Single Responsibility == one reason for changes for the abstraction / class; (include interfaces to the class); fork and spoon instead of spoork;

- Interface Segregation == separate interfaces for the needs of the client; class IEnemy: public -> I1, I2, I3, I4
