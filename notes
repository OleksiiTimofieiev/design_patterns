~ SOLID:

1. separation of concerns -> different class for a specific purposes (pesistance manager);
2. open-closed principle -> classes should be open for extantions but not mods;
3. liskov substitution principle -> derived class should be have the possibility to be substituted whereever a base class;
4. Interface segragation -> not too much in one Interface;

~ BUILDER;
~ FACTORY;
~ Absract factory;
~ Prototype (good way to copy an instance)
~ Singleton
~ Bridge (cool pimple pattern -> all secrets in cpp)
