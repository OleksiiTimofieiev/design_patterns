~ SOLID:

1. separation of concerns -> different class for a specific purposes (pesistance manager);
2. open-closed principle -> mods are ok;
3. liskov substitution principle -> derived class should be have the possibility to be substituted whereever a base class;
4. Interface segragation -> not too much in one Interface;
